        // Question set 1
        //a. Genus is the Parent class and Species is the child class. Species inherits from the Genus class
        //b. Specimen is a composition of the Species class
        //c. Diagram on the other file
        //d. Firstly, the programmers can easily create objects for the Species as it inherits the methods from the genus class.
        // Secondly, the composition relationship between the Species and Specimen classes allows the programmer to reuse code.
        //e.
        //(i). It is due to the instantiation of the human object is under the Species class which has its own toString method
        //(ii). Overriding

        //Question set 2
        //a. Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data
        // (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
        //b. The first benefit is that the access of variables can be determined accordingly which means that
        // data can be hidden from other classes.(having control over data). The second benefit is that the fields
        // can be read-only or write-only.
        //c. getName() method
        //d. name
        //f. The advantage is that the specimen class can access the methods from the Species class.
        // The disadvantage is that more specific methods and data cant be used as it is defined in the parent class.

        //Question set 3
        //a. We add another private variable with type string called marking and add this to the constructor. Then we add setter and getter.


        //Question set 4
        //a. It exports a type and a set of operations which are called the interface.
